# More Than Adventure Mod Info

## More than adventure is a mod that focuses on the expansion of adventure aspects to minecraft in all sorts of ways, with emphasis on exploration & QoL

MTA Mod (More Than Adventure) adds features the following ways:
- Gems that enhance Netherite Armor and add both buffs and debuffs, making it so you have to choose your weaknesses and strenghts according to your own goals.
- Block sets for already existing blocks.
- Enhanced Biomes & New Biome Variants
- Functional Blocks that make the life of the player easier.
- New Tameable Creatures, Animals, & Monsters.
- Adding some Overworld Ores into the Nether and End.
- New rare big clusters of Diamonds and Ancient Debris.

We plan to add **even more** features as we develop the mod, so make sure you keep yourself updated.
